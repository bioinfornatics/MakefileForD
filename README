============
MakefileForD
============

This project provides a template build system for use D project
Makefile    -> library
Makfile_exe -> executable could to be renamed
in all case you need add command.make in same directory

What you need to do:
--------------------
 - take Makefile and command.make
 - put at root of your project
 - set variables into Makefile: PROJECT_NAME, AUTHOR, DESCRIPTION, VERSION, LICENSE, SOURCES 

Tips:
-----
when you need to write a pth like for set SOURCES var use $(PATH_SEP) instead / or \ this allow support both windows and *NIX
 
How build your project:
-----------------------
In same directory where is the file Makefile do:
 $ make
 $ make install
 
Use -j flag for multithreading:
 $ make -j
 $ make install -j
 
You can override many varibale as prefix or libdir:
 $ make 
 $ make install PREFIX=/usr LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64
 
Set DFLAGS
 $ make DFLAGS="-w -d -g -O"
 
Set Include flag
 DFLAGS_IMPORT="-Idir1 -Idir2"
  
Generate tag for geany
 $ make geany-tag
 
Generate pkgconfig file
 $ make pkgfile

Generate Ddoc
 $ make ddoc

Generate shared lib:
 $ make shared-lib

Combine targets together:
$ make -j all shared-lib  ddoc DFLAGS_IMPORT="-ImySourceDir"

Default target:
 all: able to build static lib, doc, header, pkg-confih file

Others targets:
- shared-lib
- ddoc
- geany-tag

How Clean your project:
-----------------------
Each build targets has a clean target by example if you have built with "shared-lib" target use "clean-shared-lib" target

How Install your project:
-------------------------:
Each build targets has a install target by example if you have builti with "shared-lib" target use "install-shared-lib" target

RESUME:
-------

BUILD       | CLEAN            | INSTALL
___________________________________________________
all         | clean            | install
static-libs | clean-static-lib | install-static-lib
shared-lib  | clean-shared-lib | install-shared-lib
header      | clean-header     | install-header

pkgfile     | clean-pkgfile    | install-pkgfile


Feature:
--------
- Support 3 compilers: ldc, gdc, dmd
- Build as static lib or shared
- Generate geany tag
- Generate package config file

TODO:
-----
- Use pkg-config for set flag when there are some dependencies
- Add Windows support
